// Program generates a 10x10 gameboard with 5 ships of size
// 5,4,3,3 and 2 in random locations. User attempts to sink each ship
// by passing a row and column combination. User wins when all elements
// associated with each ship on board is inputted. 

// Function Pseudocode:

    // Initial setup of board takes 10x10 array and fills each element with '~'
    // Precondition: 2D array is declared of type char and passed.
    // Postcondition: All 2D array elements filled with '~' character.
void InitializeBoard(/*IN/OUT*/char BoardArray[][MAX_COLS])
{
    1. Outer For Loop: Loops through each BoardArray row.
	2. Inner For Loop: Loops through each BoardArray column.
	3. Inner Loop Body: Makes BoardArray element equal to '~'.
	
}
    // Prints a 2D array to the screen.
    // Precondition: 2D array is declared of type char and passed.
    // Post: All 2D array elements displayed on screen.
void DisplayBoard(/*IN*/char BoardArray[][MAX_COLS])
{
    1. Outer For Loop: Loops through each BoardArray row.
	2. Newline after each row.
	3. Inner For Loop: Loops through each BoardArray column.
	4. Inner Loop Body: Outputs current BoardArray element to screen.
